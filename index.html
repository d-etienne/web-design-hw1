    <h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>


    <p>
      So often we hear people screaming you need to support this… show your
      support for that… if you dont post this then you aren't in support
      of that and oftentimes it becomes confusing on how to truly support all
      the important causes in the world. I mean hell at this point I can barely
      even support myself. It doesn't even only apply to social media but other
      things like friends and family.
      And still this word is literally shoved down our throats without any
      guidance on how to go about doing so.
      I mean of course we have the monetary and boastful ways of social media
      but a post and/or simple donation isn't enough to truly support a cause
      or even a friend. Instead I propose to you that it is something a lot
      simpler that oftentimes people forget or choose to forsake in cases like
      this. Hear Me Out…
    </p>


    <h2> 1. UNDERSTANDING </h2>

    <p>
      Yes you saw right. Understanding. So often people think that just because
      they read one short post on social media or watched a simple video that
      someone posted on the internet about a cause that they should simply
      support it and dont get me wrong I happen to be guilty of the same things
      but that is not enough and oftentimes we forget about it days later as
      soon as it stops trending and popping up on our timelines. That's not true
      understanding and to be honest it does nothing to keep the original cause
      alive. Instead that is exactly what leads to the death of so many important
      causes is the fact that no one took the time to truly understand why it is
      there. Not only with important causes but with friends and family as well…
      if they are asking you for support… you need to understand their struggle,
      or goals before you offer it. Support without understanding is hollow.
      It's basically equivalent to you speaking to a stranger and stating hey….
      I support you. It doesn't mean as much because it's likely you will never
      meet that stranger again, so they have no way of holding you accountable.
      Not to mention they have no idea of your capabilities as a person.
      Thus support for the people that you care about needs to be more.
      It needs to have a foundation and that foundation is understanding.
    </p>

    <h2> 2. SUPPORT DOESNT ALWAYS EQUAL AGREEMENT </h2>

    <p>
      In many cases, people associate support with agreement but that’s not
      always the case. Sure when it comes to important causes your support does
      mean that you agree with the terms of the cause but when it comes to
      family and friends that is not the case. In fact, far from it. When you
      support someone in whatever they need support with you don't have to agree
      with what they are doing. In fact you could completely disagree with it
      yourself but as long as you have an understanding of why they would choose
      to do whatever it is that they need support in. Then you should be able to
      support them. This does however have a limit. But that is the thing, if
      they choose to do something that could cause harm and or dismay to
      themselves or others, you would probably choose not to support them anyway.
      So hearing them out and gaining some type of understanding doesn't hurt,
      if anything it will strengthen your argument when you explain why you
      choose not to support them.
    </p>

    <h2> SUPPORT IS NOT SIMPLY A ONE TIME THING </h2>

    <p>
      Lastly, so often people claim to support a cause but you will only see
      them post about it once or talk about it once with you and never speak
      about it again. That is not true support… that is just a shell of support.
      It looks a duck but doesn't quack like one so it isn't a duck. Support has
      to be continuous or else it means nothing. That doesn't mean that you have
      to talk about it all the time or even post about it every other week but
      it does mean that you have to be up to date on the things that are
      happening with the cause that you claim to support at least once a month
      or every two months. You should be talking about it with those who are
      close to you and even making sure that you take the time to spread the
      word when you can. When relating to supporting friends and family, that
      means checking up on them and actually listening to what they have to say.
      If you don't take an active interest in what they asked you to support
      them in. Then your support remains simply a shell. Supporting a person you
      care about needs to remain active because without it, at some point they
      are going to think the original support you gave was false.
    </p>

    <h2> CONCLUSION </h2>

    <p>
      Support takes its shape in many different forms and I am not saying that
      monetary and social media displays are bad. They most definitely help to
      spread important messages but when you put down that phone your display of
      support for whatever cause should not stop there. It should continue with
      you offline as well. With friends and family, your support does not stop
      with you simply stating “I support you”. You need to place a foundation of
      understanding behind these actions and words. Granted you are your own person
      and you are free to have your own opinion as to how you want to give your
      support but in case you want my opinion here it is and if you don't then
      that's fine too.
